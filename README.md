## **Technical Writing Portfolio**
The Proposal, Usability Testing, and Recommendation Report below outline a usability experiment for the Microsoft To Do application.<br />

The Proposal contains methods of the experiment, benefits, personnel and equipment, a schedule, and an informed consent form.<br />

The Usability Testing involves a meticulously crafted test plan, detailing each task to be performed by participants, the methodology for calculating error rates, a structured test log form to record observations, and thoughtfully designed pre- and post-screening questionnaires to gather user insights and feedback.<br />

The Recommendation Report presents a comprehensive overview of the test findings, an in-depth analysis of the results, and an evaluation of Microsoft To Do's effectiveness. It also includes actionable recommendations aimed at enhancing Microsoft To Do, making it more intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly for a diverse range of users.<br />

#### **Things I learned from this project.**
- **Effective Audience Analysis**:
  - I developed the skill to thoroughly analyze the demographics of my audience, enabling me to craft persuasive and targeted arguments that resonate with their specific needs and preferences.
- **Clarity and Precision in Writing**:
  - I honed my ability to structure documents in a way that enhances readability and engagement, ensuring each component is clearly organized and tailored to make the content accessible and compelling to the audience.<br />
- **Data Analysis and Interpretation**:
  - I developed the skill prioritizing issues based on impact and urgency.
- **Visual Communication**
  - I gained valuable experience in utilizing charts, graphs, and tables to present data in a way that is not only clear and visually engaging but also effective in communicating key insights. This process taught me how to choose the most appropriate visual representation for different types of data, ensure accuracy and readability, and emphasize trends or patterns that support the overall message.
